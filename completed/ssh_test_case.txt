Testing SSH connectivity using Password and Key based auth

(The steps involved depend on if you have access to a known good Username &
Password and SSH Key for the device in question. They also depend on if the
device has its ssh server properly set up. As instuctions for that feel out
of scope, I am working on the assumption that you have a working ssh server,
you know the ip and port of that device and you have a known good username and
password combination and a known good ssh key. If you need me to write
instructions for the entire process I can, just let me know.)

User/Pass authentication

Steps
1. Open a bash terminal and type `ssh {username}@{ip_address}`, replacing
the {username} and {ip_address} with your own.
2. You may see a message indicating that the authenticity of the host cannot
be established. If so, type `yes` and hit enter.*
3. You will see a password prompt, type in the known password, and hit enter.
(Note: you will not see anything appear in the password field.)
4. If you typed the password correctly, you will see your bash prompt change to
that of the user you have ssh'ed into.
5. Type `exit` to disconnect from the remote host.

*Whether or not this is an issue really depends on the setting,
and security policies in place.

PASS
If you reached the end of the steps without error ssh is working as expected.

FAIL
If at any point you hit an error that returns you to a prompt, there is a
problem with the ssh server.



SSH Key Authentication

Steps
1. Open a bash terminal and type `ssh {username}@{ip_address}`, replacing
the {username} and {ip_address} with your own.
2. You may see a message indicating that the authenticity of the host cannot
be established. If so, type `yes` and hit enter.*
4. Assuming the public and private keys match, you will see your bash prompt
change to that of the user you have ssh'ed into.
5. Type `exit` to disconnect from the remote host.

PASS
If you reached the end of the steps without error ssh is working as expected.

FAIL
If at any point you hit an error that returns you to a prompt, there is a 
problem with the ssh server.
